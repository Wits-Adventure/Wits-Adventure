# Attack Report 1
**Wits Adventure**  
**22 September 2025**

---

## Introduction

This report is a security audit regarding the supply chain attack on NPM described in the following article:  
üëâ [NPM Debug and Chalk Packages Compromised](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised)

---

## What Caused the Supply Chain Attack?

On **September 8**, Aikido identified **18 popular npm packages** that had been modified to include **malicious JavaScript**.  
The injected code executes in users‚Äô browsers, intercepts **web3/crypto activity**, and silently **redirects transactions** and **approval permissions** to attacker-controlled destinations.

Because these packages collectively see **billions of downloads per week**, the attack had massive potential reach and impact.

- ansi-styles@6.2.2  
- debug@4.4.2  
- chalk@5.6.1  
- supports-color@10.2.1  
- strip-ansi@7.1.1

## What We Can Tell From Our Product/Packages

Using `npm ls` to determine our application‚Äôs installed packages, we can see the following:

- @babel/core@7.28.3
- @babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs@7.27.1
- @babel/plugin-transform-runtime@7.28.3
- @babel/preset-env@7.28.3
- @babel/preset-react@7.27.1
- @testing-library/dom@10.4.1
- @testing-library/jest-dom@6.8.0
- @testing-library/react@14.3.1
- @testing-library/user-event@14.6.1
- babel-jest@27.5.1
- codecov@3.8.3
- docsify@4.13.1
- firebase@12.0.0
- identity-obj-proxy@3.0.0
- jest-dom@4.0.0
- jest-environment-jsdom@27.5.1
- jest@27.5.1
- jquery@3.7.1
- lucide-react@0.542.0
- react-dom@18.3.1
- react-icons@5.5.0
- react-router-dom@6.30.1
- react-scripts@5.0.1
- react-toastify@11.0.5
- react@18.3.1
- router-dom@3.0.3
- routes@2.1.0
- web-vitals@2.1.4

As we can see, there‚Äôs **no overlap** in packages when comparing with the list of compromised packages from NPM.

However, many of those packages (e.g., `ansi-styles`, `chalk`, `strip-ansi`, `color-convert`) are **commonly used as transitive dependencies** by tools like **Babel**, **Jest**, and **React Scripts**.  
That means even if they‚Äôre not directly installed, they could still exist deeper in the dependency tree.

Therefore, we used a custom Python tool (`malwareChecker.py`) to inspect our dependency tree.

Fortunately, our application doesn‚Äôt depend on any compromised packages ‚Äî directly or indirectly ‚Äî and it would likely have been unaffected regardless, as our web app does not involve **real-world financial transactions**.

---

## Algorithm 1 ‚Äî `malwareChecker`

```python
1: Define list of compromised packages
2: Load package-lock.json as JSON

FindCompromised(dependencies, path)
3: Initialize empty list of matches
4: for all (package, info) in dependencies do
5:     fullPath ‚Üê path + package
6:     if package in compromised list then
7:         Add fullPath to matches
8:     end if
9:     if info contains nested dependencies then
10:        Recursively call FindCompromised on nested dependencies
11:        Append results to matches
12:    end if
13: end for
14: return matches

15: Call FindCompromised on root dependencies
16: if any matches found then
17:     Print ‚ÄúCompromised packages found‚Äù and list matches
18: else
19:     Print ‚ÄúNo compromised packages found‚Äù
20: end if
```

## Preventive Measures

To protect against infections from upstream sources, the first measure is to **secure your dependency management process**.  
This includes:

- Locking dependencies to **exact versions**  
- Regularly auditing them with tools like `npm audit`, **Snyk**, or **Dependabot**  
- Using **integrity checks** to ensure no tampering has occurred  
- Hosting a **private package registry** or mirroring trusted versions  
- Preventing unverified packages from being pulled from public registries  

The second measure is to **integrate proactive security monitoring** into your workflow.  
Tools like **Aikido SafeChain** or similar wrappers can:
- Intercept package installations  
- Verify packages against **threat intelligence databases** before installation  

When combined with **continuous CI/CD scanning**, **sandboxed testing of updates**, and **reducing unnecessary dependencies**, this approach creates a strong defense against supply chain compromise.

# Attack Report 2
**Wits Adventure**  
**15 October 2025**

---

## Introduction
This report is a security audit regarding the supply chain attack on NPM described in the following article:  
üëâ [TinyColor Supply Chain Attack Affects 40+ Packages](https://socket.dev/blog/tinycolor-supply-chain-attack-affects-40-packages)

---

## What Caused the Supply Chain Attack?

The TinyColor supply chain attack was caused by **compromised maintainer accounts** across multiple npm packages.  
The attacker gained unauthorized access and published malicious versions of over **40 packages**.

The attack employed a **sophisticated automated trojanization mechanism** ‚Äî the malicious code included a function called `NpmModule.updatePackage` that:
1. Downloaded a package tarball  
2. Modified its `package.json`  
3. Injected a malicious script (`bundle.js`)  
4. Repacked the archive  
5. Republished it  

This created a **self-propagating attack** that automatically spread to downstream packages.

The **point of failure** was npm‚Äôs account security infrastructure, where multiple maintainer credentials were compromised through credential theft, phishing, or weak authentication mechanisms.

## What We Can Tell From Our Product/Packages

Using `npm ls` to determine our application‚Äôs installed packages, we can see the following:

- @babel/core@7.28.3
- @babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs@7.27.1
- @babel/plugin-transform-runtime@7.28.3
- @babel/preset-env@7.28.3
- @babel/preset-react@7.27.1
- @testing-library/dom@10.4.1
- @testing-library/jest-dom@6.8.0
- @testing-library/react@14.3.1
- @testing-library/user-event@14.6.1
- babel-jest@27.5.1
- codecov@3.8.3
- docsify@4.13.1
- firebase@12.0.0
- identity-obj-proxy@3.0.0
- jest-dom@4.0.0
- jest-environment-jsdom@27.5.1

- react-toastify@11.0.5
- react@18.3.1
- router-dom@3.0.3
- routes@2.1.0
- web-vitals@2.1.4

As we can see, there‚Äôs **no overlap** in packages when comparing with the list of compromised NPM packages.

Unlike the Aikido attack which targeted commonly used utility packages, the TinyColor attack focused on **specialized packages** (primarily `@ctrl/*` and `@nativescript-community/*` packages).  
However, we must still verify **transitive dependencies**.

---

## Custom Malware Checker Script

Therefore, we used a custom Python tool (`malwareChecker v2.py`) to check the dependencies of our tools.

Fortunately, our application doesn‚Äôt depend on any compromised packages either directly or transitively.

The `bundle.js` malware in this attack was particularly dangerous as it:
- Downloaded **TruffleHog** to harvest credentials  
- Created persistent **GitHub Actions workflows** for exfiltration  
- Stole **npm tokens**, **GitHub tokens**, and **cloud credentials**

---

## Algorithm 2 ‚Äî `malwareChecker v2`

```python
1: Define list of compromised packages (40+ from TinyColor attack)
2: Load package-lock.json as JSON

FindCompromised(dependencies, path)
3: Initialize empty list of matches
4: for all (package, info) in dependencies do
5:     fullPath ‚Üê path + package
6:     if package in compromised list then
7:         Add fullPath to matches
8:     end if
9:     if info contains nested dependencies then
10:        Recursively call FindCompromised on nested dependencies
11:        Append results to matches
12:    end if
13: end for
14: return matches

15: Call FindCompromised on root dependencies
16: if any matches found then
17:     Print ‚ÄúCompromised packages found‚Äù and list matches
18: else
19:     Print ‚ÄúNo compromised packages found‚Äù
20: end if
```

## Preventive Measures

To protect against infections from upstream sources, the first measure is to **secure your dependency management process**:

- Lock dependencies to exact versions
- Regularly audit with tools like `npm audit`, Snyk, or Socket Security
- Use integrity checks to detect tampering
- Host a private package registry or mirror trusted versions
- Implement pre-install verification tools that check packages against threat intelligence databases

The second measure is to **protect your development and CI/CD environments from credential theft**:

- Never store production credentials on developer machines or CI/CD environments
- Use scoped npm tokens with minimal permissions
- Enforce multi-factor authentication for all registry accounts
- Regularly rotate credentials
- Consider disabling postinstall scripts using the `--ignore-scripts` flag and reviewing them manually
- Deploy monitoring for unauthorized GitHub Actions workflow creation
- Block access to cloud metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254`)
- Use endpoint detection, network monitoring, and immutable ephemeral build agents

These combined measures provide a robust defense against both supply chain attacks and subsequent lateral movement.
