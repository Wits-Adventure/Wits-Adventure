### Methodologies

| Type | Methodology | Reason for Choice |

| **Git** | **Trunk-based development** | This methodology is centred around developers either commiting directly to main or creating short-lived branches. The focus is on small, incremental changes, which is a good fit for Agile and CI/CD. Key advantages are: The main branch is always up to date. Small merges prevent branches from diverging too far from main, which would cause large conflicts that are difficult to merge.

| **Project Management** | **Agile** | We decided Agile was a good choice because we were familiar with it and it worked well for us in the first semester. We aim to do weekly scrum meetings |
