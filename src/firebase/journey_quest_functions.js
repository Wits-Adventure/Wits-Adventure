/*  Journey Quests
    Equivalent to treasure hunt quests, but i thought this name was cooler.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Quest attempter is given pictures of locations, with an accompanying riddle for each one forming the quest chain
    instead of using scannables that could end up as litter, we could just store the geolocation data of each location,(api integration) 
    then our user can verify that they've reached the locations by a tap of a button, so they can immediately continue the quest without
    waiting for admin approval of their progress. No search radius given except for the final location in the chain
